So this web scraping for the car covers in OLA (`https://www.olx.in/items/q-car-cover`) had been done using the Selenium.
- Usage:You can run the `olx_cover_scrapper.py` by installing selenium and chrome driver.
- You can activate the conda env and then install using the pip.
```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
```
- Then you can run `olx_cover_scrapper.py` ,so this will generate a `car_cover_listings.json` which contains the title and the cost of car-cover that are been available in the OLX page.
